            <p>Spaghetti Recipe In Creamy Tomato Sauce is a delicious recipe for the kids where the pasta is made saucy
                with Del Monte Spaghetti Pasta. The pasta is packed with flavors from the tomato basil sauce, garlic and
                basil, making it refreshing. The addition of roasted carrots and capsicum makes this pasta great tasting
                and healthy as well.</p>
            <p>In this dish we have used the Del Monte Spaghetti Pasta that uses durum wheat to make it. Durum wheat is
                made from the endosperm of the wheat which is yellow in color and ground to make it into semolina or
                fine sooji and is considered to have a good protein content.</p>
