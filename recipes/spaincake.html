    <h3>METHOD</h3>

    <div class="steplist">
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a large 12" skillet for which you have a lid and add potatoes and onions. We used a ¼ cup of oil for this recipe, and that is considered a lighter version. Traditionally the potatoes will cook in a lot more oil, we kept it a little lighter by covering the skillet while the potatoes are cooking. This way they cook faster and less oil can be used to cook them. If you don't mind using more oil, go ahead and double the amount of oil and fry the potatoes and onions in batched until tender.</li>
            <li>Cooked covered until the potatoes are cooked.</li>
            <li>Let the cooked potatoes and onions cool. Beat eggs in a bowl and add cooled potatoes and onions and return the mixture to a 10.5" skillet. Make sure you have a lid that fits that skillet, so you can flip the tortilla de patatas.</li>
            <li>Cook the Tortilla de Patatas well on one side before flipping it to the other side. Watch this 5-second video showing how to flip a tortilla de patatas. It's not nearly as hard as it seems with this simple technique.</li>
            <li>Slide the tortilla de patatas back into the skillet after flipping it.</li>
            <li>Cook the other side of the Tortilla de Patatas.</li>
            <li>When done place in a plate in slice into 8 even wedges.</li>
            <li>ENJOY!</li>
        </ol>
