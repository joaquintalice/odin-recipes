    <p>Milanesa a la napolitana consists of a thin slice of beef filet, dipped in a mixture of eggs and then coated with breadcrumbs before pan-fried. The fried steak is then topped with tomato sauce, ham and mozzarella cheese and then baked in the oven like a pizza. It is typically served with French fries or white rice.</p>

    <p>Ingredients</p>
    <ul>

        <li>Dip all the freshly fried cutlets in the coulis and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
