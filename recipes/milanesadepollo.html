    <p>Milanesa a la napolitana consists of a thin slice of beef filet, dipped in a mixture of eggs and then coated with breadcrumbs before pan-fried. The fried steak is then topped with tomato sauce, ham and mozzarella cheese and then baked in the oven like a pizza. It is typically served with French fries or white rice.</p>
