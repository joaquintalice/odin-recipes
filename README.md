Brief introduction: This project will test my actual knowledge of HTML. Is only HTML, so, probably the look is not the best.
In this project I reinforced knowledge of HTML, exactly in ordered lists, unordered list, paragraphs, bold words and the usual boilerplate of HTML. Without css.
<!--Update-->
When i finished the HTML. I tried add style with CSS and i get a minimalist design really pretty.
Basic, but pretty.
I added responsive design too with "media queries" and some animations with "keyframes". My responsive design is based in max-width 640 px.
